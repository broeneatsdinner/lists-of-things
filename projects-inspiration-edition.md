# Projects Inspiation Edition
~~Projects 2025 Edition~~

Spring is a time for action, and action is a powerful antidote: to lethargy, boredom, anxiety, and even all-out despair.

Last spring, I published my first list of ideas for spring projectsâ€”a resource to help coax and inspire us all to get back out there, to re-engage dormant hands and get the gears turning again. 

This year, I'm excited to present the follow-up, including projects with fewer barriers to entry, and a new category called "Being." Some entries might be familiar (like axe sharpening), while others (like tramping) serve as small "instigators" to do with what you please. 

Regardless of the level of your spring ambition, I hope this list inspires some momentum.
